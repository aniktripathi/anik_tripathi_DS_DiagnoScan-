# DiagnoScan 🩺🧠

**DiagnoScan** is an AI-powered diagnostic tool that uses machine learning to predict patient diagnoses from structured medical reports. It leverages a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier to provide interpretable, fast, and accurate predictions — accompanied by visual explanations for enhanced trust and transparency.

## 🔍 Features

- 🏥 Accepts structured patient reports (lab values, clinical data)
- 🤖 Predicts medical conditions using SVM classification
- 📊 Visualizes health metrics and prediction confidence
- 🧾 Interpretable outputs for clinical decision support
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight — ideal for scalable use in healthcare environments

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Input**: A structured patient report is uploaded or entered.
2. **Processing**: Features are extracted and fed into a trained SVM model.
3. **Prediction**: The model outputs a diagnosis with probability/confidence.
4. **Visualization**: Key metrics are visualized using charts for interpretation.

## 🧠 Why SVM?

Support Vector Machines are:
- Great for **high-dimensional**, clinical datasets
- Ideal for **binary/multi-class classification**
- Robust with **limited samples** (common in healthcare)
- Naturally support **margin-based** decisions
